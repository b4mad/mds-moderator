- fair
  - if one participants has a larger amount of talking time
  - per topic and per whole
  - there should be reminder during the meeting, after the meeting, and in the summary
- keep the flow and everybody on board
  - if a topic gets too deep, or does not provide enough details for non pros
  - bot summarizes the last topic, ask for clarification and maybe some background
  - if a topic relays on old meetings, the bot interrupts by adding the information from the other meeting in a summary, and provides a link
